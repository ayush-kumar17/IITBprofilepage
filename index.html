                <p>I am currently pursuing an M.Tech in Computer Science at IIT Bombay, where I am deepening my
                    understanding of advanced concepts in computing and working on impactful academic projects. I
                    completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from GBPIET, where I developed a solid
                    foundation in programming, systems, and theoretical computer science. Earlier, I completed both my
                    10th (85.8%) and 12th (87.6%) from Kendriya Vidyalaya, Rishikesh, consistently performing well
                    academically and building a strong interest in STEM fields.</p>
                <p>My academic interests include core computer science subjects such as Operating Systems, Database
                    Management Systems, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, Theory of Computation, Compiler
                    Design, Computer Networks, and Data Structures and Algorithms. I am also actively exploring Deep
                    Learning and Big Data technologies, aiming to apply them in real-world applications.</p>
                <p> On the development side, I have worked on projects like a Hotstar Clone, a Weather Forecast App, and
                    several small-scale web applications that showcase my front-end and back-end skills. In the field of
                    AI/ML, I have developed a Skin Cancer Detection system using deep learning and performed TV Series
                    Analysis leveraging neural network models and data visualization techniques.</p>
                <p>
                    I enjoy solving challenging problems, building scalable solutions, and continuously learning new
                    technologies. I'm enthusiastic about contributing to innovative projects and collaborating in
                    research and development environments that push the boundaries of technology.</p>

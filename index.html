      <p>
        I'm currently doing my M.Tech in Computer Science at IIT Bombay. It's been a great experience so far — I'm getting to explore advanced CS concepts and also work on some interesting academic projects. Before this, I completed my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering from GBPIET, where I built a strong foundation in core computer science subjects and programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        My school journey started at Kendriya Vidyalaya in Rishikesh, where I completed both my 10th and 12th. I scored 85.8% in 10th and 87.6% in 12th. Those years really helped me develop a curiosity for STEM fields and gave me the confidence to pursue computer science seriously.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m especially interested in core subjects like OS, DBMS, TOC, CN, Compilers, and also in emerging areas like Machine Learning, Deep Learning, and Big Data. I enjoy figuring out how things work under the hood, and I'm always looking to connect theory with real-world applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the development side, I’ve built projects like a Hotstar clone, a weather forecast app, and a few small web applications. In the AI/ML space, I worked on a skin cancer detection system using deep learning, and did a TV series analysis project involving neural networks and visualizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I genuinely enjoy solving problems and building things that work. Whether it's a coding project, a research task, or just exploring a new tech stack — I like the process of learning and improving. I’m always open to new ideas and love collaborating on meaningful and challenging projects.
